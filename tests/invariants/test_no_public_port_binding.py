"""SPEC 17.4: the connector is never published on every interface.

/health and /metrics are deliberately unauthenticated, which is only safe
because the port is unreachable from outside the tailnet. A bare
"8820:8820" mapping in docker-compose.yml binds 0.0.0.0 on the host and
undoes that. This test makes the regression impossible to reintroduce
quietly.
