Two halves, both live.

The static half fails if anyone puts a `time.sleep` or a blocking
`requests`-style post into connector/ or into a copied handler.

The end-to-end half builds the real object graph through
lifecycle.wire_real_deps(), parks an AdvancedMD reply inside the real
sender loop, and asserts GET /health keeps answering in milliseconds.
AdvancedMD is an httpx.MockTransport: no network call is made and no
