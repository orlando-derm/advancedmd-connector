"""SPEC 23.5: load and fairness.

A batch token submits 200 getdemographic calls while an interactive token
submits one every 5 s. This is the whole pipeline -- the real EntryQueue,
the real Worker, the real copied getdemographic handler, the real
AMDClient shim, the real send() seam, the real Sender loop and the real
RateClock -- with two things injected:

  * time. `VirtualTime` supplies monotonic() and sleep() so a twenty
    minute load run finishes in seconds and every assertion is on an
    exact number rather than on a wall clock.
  * AdvancedMD. It is an httpx.MockTransport whose reply is a synthetic
    fixture - hand-written from reference client XML shapes, contains no
    real patient data. Nothing leaves the process and no credential here
    is real.
