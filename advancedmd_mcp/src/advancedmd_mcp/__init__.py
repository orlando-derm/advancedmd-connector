"""advancedmd-mcp: the local stdio shim. SPEC 12.3.

It speaks MCP over stdio to an agent on a workstation and turns every
call into an HTTP request to the connector. It holds no AdvancedMD
credentials, no tool logic and no AdvancedMD knowledge: the tool list
comes from GET /v1/tools at start-up and every tools/call becomes POST
/v1/tools. Swapping an agent between this shim and the remote surface
(SPEC 12.2) changes no tool name, no schema and no result shape.
