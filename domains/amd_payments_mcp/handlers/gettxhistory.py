"""amd_payments_get_tx_history - AMD gettxhistory action.

Doc source: runtime/cache/amd-doc-extract.md:3221 (paraphrased per
NDA).

Returns a patient's financial history: charges + payments + write-offs
on one envelope. Per Q3 (C5.0) raw amount fields are REDACTED at the
redactor layer; status flags + DOS dates remain visible.

Enriched envelope (Aaron 2026-06-04: "it cannot do any math or
aggregations properly" — no raw list, no raw blob):
- ``count``: number of charge rows.
- ``by_provcode``: ``{provcode: count}`` — natural grouping for
  "which providers saw this patient?"
- ``by_void``: ``{"0"|"1": count}``.
- ``by_paymentplan``: ``{"0"|"1": count}``.

`sum_amount` is INTENTIONALLY OMITTED. Per the payments domain's Q3
policy, amount fields are PHI-redacted before the LLM sees them.
Aggregating redacted markers ("<REDACTED>") would yield meaningless
totals, and aggregating raw amounts at this layer would bypass the
redactor. Per the plan: don't fabricate numbers.
