"""amd_billing_get_charge_detail_data - AMD getchargedetaildata action.

Doc source: raw AMD doc extract line 5610 (sample XML +
`<ppmdmsg action="getchargedetaildata" class="demographics"
 msgtime="..." chargeid="..."/>`).

Per Q2 (C4.0): financial amount fields (`fee`, `paid`, `patbalance`,
`insbalance`, `patportion`, `insportion`, `allowed`, `netfee`,
`totalvisitcharges`, `cobcode`, write-off codes) and reason text fields
(`note`, `lineitemnote`, `holdreason*`) are REDACTed via the per-action
policy. Status flags (`void`, `protected`, `billins`, `insbilled`,
`paymentplan`, `apptstatus`) are KEPT.

Returns ONLY pre-computed cardinality + group-bys (Aaron 2026-06-04:
"it cannot do any math or aggregations properly"):
- ``count``: number of charges in the response (typically 1; AMD's
  charge detail can carry a visit with multiple line items).
- ``by_void``: ``{"0"|"1": count}`` — voided vs active.
- ``by_billins``: ``{"0"|"1": count}`` — billed-to-insurance flag.

Aggregate financial amounts are intentionally NOT summed here — they
are PHI-redacted per the domain policy and aggregating redacted
markers is meaningless.
