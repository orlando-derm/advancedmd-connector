"""Frozen seams. Every lane imports from here; nobody redefines these.

This module is a CONTRACT, not an implementation. It contains Protocols
and abstract signatures only: no I/O, no HTTP library, no AMD URL, no
state. Changing a signature here is a change to every lane at once, so
treat it the way SPEC 11.6 treats the HTTP contract.

Implementations live where SPEC 20 says they live:
  send        -> connector/sender.py      (SPEC 6.2)
  RateClock   -> connector/clock.py       (SPEC 7)
  Session     -> connector/session.py     (SPEC 8)
  TokenTable  -> connector/tokens.py      (SPEC 10)
  Registry    -> connector/registry.py    (SPEC 9)
  Auditor     -> connector/audit.py       (SPEC 17.2)
