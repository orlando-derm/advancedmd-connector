"""The tool registry, SPEC 9.1 (plus Amendment D-1 aliases).

Built at startup from the nine copied domain packages using their own
build_specs() machinery and their policy files, exactly as the domain
servers do. Nothing is re-derived here: the policy file supplies the
canonical tool name, the write flag and the domain; the generated JSON
Schema supplies the argument schema; the handler module supplies the
callable.

Three things this module adds on top of build_specs():

1. Aliases (Amendment D-1 / resolved ambiguity A1). The policy tool_name
   is the canonical registry key; each Appendix A tool also answers to
   its bare AMD action name. get() resolves either spelling to the same
   entry; canonical_names() lists only the canonical ones so MCP
   tools/list keeps SPEC 12.1 parity with today's amd-mcp.
2. Verification state (SPEC 9.2), from connector/verification.py.
3. Tier (SPEC 7.4). The tier table lives in connector/clock.py and is the
   only authority; a `tier_for` callable is injected so this module never
   becomes a second copy of it. The local fallback exists so the registry
   can be built before the clock is wired, and it is deliberately the
   SPEC 7.4 rule itself (Appendix A rows, then getupdated* -> 1, then 3)
   rather than a second full table.

Fail-fast (SPEC 16.1 step 4): if any Appendix A tool is missing from the
built registry, build_registry raises. A connector that cannot serve its
launch set must not start pretending it can.
