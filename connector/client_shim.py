"""An AMDClient-shaped facade over send(). Amendment D-2 / resolved A2.

amd-mcp's vendored amd_client/client.py opens sockets and drives its own
login and rate limiter, so copying it into domains/ would violate
SPEC 6.2 and give the process a second clock. Instead this module offers
the same method surface -- call(), get_patient_bundle(),
get_visits_for_date(), get_appointments_via_reminders() -- implemented as
pure XML request construction plus `await send()`. Copied handlers get
one of these objects from their client factory and their call sites do
not change.

What this module deliberately does NOT do:
  - import httpx, requests, or any HTTP client
  - name or construct an AdvancedMD URL
  - log in, hold a token, retry, sleep, or rate-limit
Login belongs to connector/session.py, pacing to connector/clock.py, and
retries to the sender loop (SPEC 15: "Handlers MUST NOT sleep or retry on
their own").

Request shapes below are transcribed from the reference implementations:
amd-mcp/amd_client/client.py and the four backend vendored clients
(appointment-validator, srt-auths, patient-intake, note-audit). Their
inline provenance notes are kept, because those notes record what
AdvancedMD actually accepts.
