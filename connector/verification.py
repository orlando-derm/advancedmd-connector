"""Verification state, SPEC 9.2 and 9.3.

Every tool the connector registers carries a verification state. Only a
verified tool is served: an unverified tool is still LISTED (SPEC 9.2, so
agents can see it exists) but the worker returns ToolUnverified without
running the handler and without spending an AMD call.

The launch set is Appendix A. Nothing else is verified, and nothing here
promotes a tool on its own: a row appears in LAUNCH_SET only after its
request map and result shape are recorded in docs/TOOL_TO_XML_MAP.md.

SPEC 9.3 has five steps. Steps 1, 3, 4 and 5 are satisfied in this repo
(request map from the reference clients, synthetic fixture plus an
Appendix B assertion, tier table, Appendix C defects fixed). Step 2 --
one live call against AdvancedMD by the operator on black-sky returning
success="1" -- is by construction NOT something this build can perform:
no process here may contact AdvancedMD. Each row therefore carries
live_check=PENDING_OPERATOR and `LIVE_CHECK_PENDING` is True for the
whole table. That is recorded honestly rather than claimed.

A row is therefore NOT verified: is_verified() requires all five items,
the live check included, so no Appendix A tool is verified in this repo
until the operator records a date (docs/OPERATIONS.md). is_served()
answers the separate question of whether the worker may run the handler:
the same thing, unless CONNECTOR_SERVE_PENDING_VERIFICATION (SPEC 19) is
true, in which case a row whose ONLY gap is the live check is served and
/health reports the posture as degraded.
