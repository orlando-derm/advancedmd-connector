"""The one log filter, and the logging policy. SPEC 17.3.

There is exactly ONE filter in the process and it is attached to the
root handler, so every logger -- ours, uvicorn's, a copied handler's --
passes through it. Its job:

  * redact any value longer than 200 characters, wherever it appears:
    the message, a %-format argument, or a structured `extra` field.
  * redact any key named password, token, usercontext, result or args,
    whatever its length.

Even at DEBUG, bodies are not logged. That is the point of the length
rule: an AMD XML body, a result dict or an args dict is long, and a
short one still dies on its key name.

Levels (SPEC 17.3): INFO for lifecycle and audit, WARNING for degraded
states / 429s / 1025s, ERROR for internal exceptions with a request_id.
DEBUG is never enabled in production; configure() refuses to hand httpx
anything below WARNING so no HTTP library can log a body.
