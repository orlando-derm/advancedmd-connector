# Caller tokens and policy (SPEC 10)

Operator reference for `CONNECTOR_TOKENS_PATH`. Nothing in this file is a
real token: every value shown is a placeholder. Real plaintext tokens are
printed once by `connector tokens add` and exist only in the consuming
app's Coolify environment.

## The table

A single JSON file. One row per issued token; two live rows for one name
are allowed during rotation.

```
{"callers": [
  {"name": "appointment-validator", "hash": "sha256:<64 hex chars>",
   "priority": "batch", "phi": true, "raw_xml": false, "may_write": [],
   "tools": ["getreminderappts", "getdemographic", "getdatevisits"],
   "per_minute": null, "max_queue": 500,
   "created": "2026-08-20", "revoked": null}
]}
```

Fields are SPEC 10.3. `tools` is `"*"` or a list; either spelling of a
tool is accepted (Amendment D-1), so `getdemographic` and
`amd_patients_get_demographic` mean the same entry. `max_queue` defaults
to 100 for interactive and 500 for batch.

## Lifecycle

- Loaded at startup. A missing or malformed file is a startup failure:
  the connector does not come up with an empty deny-everything table.
- Re-read on SIGHUP, and when the file's mtime changed (checked at most
  every 30 s). A malformed file on re-read is ignored and the last good
  table stays in force.
- Revoked tokens fail with 401 on the next request; in-flight records
  complete.

## Issuance

```
connector tokens add <name> --priority batch|interactive [--phi] [--raw-xml] \
    [--may-write uploadfile] [--tools a,b,c] [--per-minute N]
connector tokens revoke <name>
connector tokens list
```

`add` prints the plaintext once; it is never stored and never logged.
`list` shows names and policy and never shows hashes.

## Launch callers (SPEC 10.4)

The commands that reproduce the launch table. Run them inside the
connector image with `CONNECTOR_TOKENS_PATH` set.

```
connector tokens add admin-console          --priority interactive --tools ""
connector tokens add chatbot                --priority interactive
connector tokens add agent-cursor           --priority interactive
connector tokens add agent-claude-code      --priority interactive
connector tokens add appointment-validator  --priority batch --phi \
    --tools getreminderappts,getdemographic,getdatevisits
connector tokens add srt-auths              --priority batch --phi \
    --tools getreminderappts,getdemographic,getupdatedvisits
connector tokens add note-audit             --priority batch --phi --raw-xml \
    --tools getreminderappts,getehrnotes,gettxhistory,getchargedetaildata,getdemographic
connector tokens add patient-intake         --priority batch --phi \
    --may-write uploadfile \
    --tools lookuppatient,getdemographic,uploadfile
```

Notes:

- admin-console uses `/v1/login` only, so its tool allowlist is empty and
  every tool call it makes is denied by default.
- patient-intake's `uploadfile` also needs the global gate
  `WRITE_TOOLS_ENABLED=true`; `may_write` alone is not enough.
- The write gate and the allowlist are both default deny. A tool absent
  from `tools` is `tool_forbidden`, not a 404.
