# knowledge/integrations/amd

Per-action policy files for AdvancedMD MCP tools. One file per AMD
action, validated against `amd-mcp-server-common/policy.schema.json`.

```

## Schema version

Per-action policies validate against `amd-mcp-policy/v1.1`. The 2026-06-04
bump from v1.0 added:
- domain enum: `ehr`, `masterfiles`, `system`, `meta`
- top-level `beta: bool` flag (DUO-8)
- top-level `requires_streaming: bool` flag (DUO-13)
- conditional-nullable `tool_name` (allowed only when `domain == "meta"`,
  per DUO-1).

Legacy v1 policy files remain valid via `oneOf:[v1, v1.1]` on `$schema`.

## Why this is PROMOTED (not draft)

Chatbot CLAUDE.md rule #4 says new knowledge is written as `.draft.`
This subtree is an exception: policy files are NOT free-form knowledge.
They are dataclass configuration validated by a JSON schema and
EXECUTED at runtime by per-domain MCP servers. Promoted-status reflects
that they participate in the runtime contract.

Aaron's sign-off gates the SCHEMA (this file + schema.md +
`amd-mcp-server-common/policy.schema.json`). Per-action content for
amd-patients-mcp is curated in F5 of the foundation plan.
