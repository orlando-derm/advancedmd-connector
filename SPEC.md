# advancedmd-connector: Specification

Version 1.0, 2026-08-20. Status: FINAL for build. This is the build
contract. docs/CONNECTOR_DECISIONS.md records why each choice was made;
this document records what is built. Where they disagree, this document
wins and the decision file is amended.

Conventions: MUST means a build that does otherwise is wrong. SHOULD
means do it unless there is a recorded reason not to. Numbers in tables
are defaults and are configurable only where the table says so.

## 1. Purpose and scope

### 1.1 What it is

advancedmd-connector is one program that is the only component in the
organization that communicates with AdvancedMD. Every consumer of
AdvancedMD data, whether a backend workflow or an AI agent, sends it a
tool call and receives a result. It holds the only AdvancedMD
credentials, the only login session, and the only rate clock.

### 1.2 Why

Today fifteen processes each hold AdvancedMD credentials, log in
independently, and rate-limit independently: nine MCP containers, the
chatbot's boot login and auth login, and four batch workflows. AdvancedMD
caps calls per minute per office key and bills one cent per excess call;
it also refuses logins more often than about once per minute. No process
can see the others' traffic, so the caps are enforced by hope. The
chatbot's shared-token mechanism exists to paper over the login limit.

### 1.3 Goals

G1. One process, one session, one clock. AdvancedMD's per-minute caps are
    enforced for real.
G2. AdvancedMD credentials exist in exactly one place. Consumers hold a
    connector URL and a per-app token.
G3. Interactive requests are never stuck behind batch jobs.
G4. No behavior change for consumers: workflows keep method names and
    typed results; agents keep tool names, schemas, and redacted shapes.
G5. The nine-domain tool exposure that works today is carried over
    unchanged.
G6. Any agent can install the AdvancedMD tools the way it installs any
    standard MCP server.
G7. A new engineer can read the README and run it in ten minutes.

### 1.4 Non-goals

N1. Renaming the Python packages inside the copied domain code.
N2. A normalized JSON schema for AdvancedMD entities. Results are what
    handlers return today (Appendix B freezes them).
N3. The Playwright-based portal MCP (amd-portal-mcp).
N4. Multiple office keys. One key; the clock is structured per key so a
    second is a table change.
N5. Running two tools concurrently. Designed for; not built (section 25).
N6. Modifying the existing amd-mcp repository or its containers.

---

## 2. Vocabulary

Every term below is used with exactly this meaning.

- AdvancedMD, AMD: the practice-management vendor and its XML API.
- office key: AdvancedMD's identifier for one practice; rate caps are per
  office key.
- action: an AdvancedMD operation name, e.g. getdemographic. Actions have
  a class (e.g. demographic) and attributes.
- attribute, attr: a named value on an AMD XML element, e.g.
  patientid="12345".
- children, template: child XML elements on an AMD request that list the
  fields to return.
- tier: AdvancedMD's cost class for an action (1, 2, 3), each with its
  own per-minute cap.
- tool: a named operation with named arguments, e.g.
  getdemographic(patient_id). The only unit of request the connector
  accepts.
- tool call: one request asking for one tool with arguments.
- handler: the Python function implementing one tool.
- AMD request: one XML message to AdvancedMD. A tool may make one or
  several.
- tree: an AMD XML reply parsed into nested objects (lxml).
- record: the connector's in-memory object for one tool call in
  progress.
- slot: an empty result holder (asyncio.Future). The code waiting on a
  slot wakes when it is filled.
- receiver: the per-request handler call that holds the caller's open
  connection and waits on the record's slot.
- entry queue: the priority queue of records waiting to run.
- worker loop: the single loop that pops records and runs tools.
- request queue: the queue of AMD requests waiting to be sent.
- sender loop: the single loop that pops AMD requests, paces them with
  the clock, sends them, fills their slots.
- caller: the app or agent identified by its token.
- priority: interactive or batch; a property of the caller.
- dict: a Python mapping of names to values; JSON is its text form.
- dataclass: a Python object with fixed, named, typed fields.
- PHI: protected health information.

One process. One port (default 8820). Everything above the dashed box is
a consumer; nothing outside the box holds AMD credentials or sends XML.

---

## 4. Process model and concurrency

4.1 The connector is a single Python process running an asyncio event
    loop under uvicorn, serving a FastAPI application.

4.2 Receivers are async handler calls; hundreds may be waiting at once at
    negligible cost.

4.3 The worker loop and the sender loop are two long-lived asyncio tasks
    started at application startup.

4.4 MUST: no blocking I/O on the event loop. The sender loop MUST use an
    async HTTP client (httpx.AsyncClient) for AdvancedMD. Any copied
    handler code that performs blocking I/O (file reads, requests.post)
    MUST be wrapped in asyncio.to_thread or rewritten. A test MUST assert
    that a slow AMD reply does not delay /health.

4.5 Exactly one tool runs at a time (worker loop concurrency 1). Exactly
    one AMD request is in flight at a time (sender loop concurrency 1).
    Both are constants in code, not configuration, in version 1.

4.6 The clock, the session, the token table, and the registry are
    process-wide singletons created at startup and shared by reference.

4.7 Horizontal scaling is forbidden: two connector instances would be two
    clocks. Deployment MUST run one replica. /health reports an instance
    id so duplicate instances are detectable.

---

## 5. Entry side

### 5.1 Receiver

On each POST /v1/tools (and each MCP tool invocation, which is routed to
the same code path):

1. Read the bearer token. Look it up (section 10). Unknown or revoked:
   respond 401 unauthorized immediately; no record is created.
2. Parse body into tool (str), args (dict), max_wait_ms (int, optional).
   Malformed: 400 bad_request.
3. Resolve defaults from the caller's policy: priority, max_wait_ms if
   absent.
4. Check global and per-caller queue caps (section 15). Over cap:
   503 queue_full with Retry-After.
5. Build the record (5.2). Put it in the entry queue. Await the record's
   slot with a timeout of max_wait_ms + execution allowance (section 15).
6. On wake: serialize the slot's value (result or error) as the response
   body (section 11.1). On receiver timeout (the slot never filled):
   respond 504 connector_timeout and mark the record abandoned so the
   worker skips it if it has not started.

The receiver holds the caller's connection the entire time. The record
never contains the connection.

### 5.2 Record

```
ToolRequest
  id            uuid4, for audit correlation
  tool          str
  args          dict
  caller        str               from token
  priority      int               0 interactive, 1 batch; from token
  arrived_at    monotonic float
  max_wait_ms   int
  abandoned     bool              set if the receiver timed out
  slot          asyncio.Future    result dict or exception
```

### 5.3 Entry queue

- Ordered by effective priority, then arrived_at. Effective priority is
  the token's priority, promoted to interactive when the record has
  waited longer than BATCH_AGING_MS (section 15) so batch cannot starve.
- Implemented as an asyncio.PriorityQueue keyed on
  (effective_priority, arrived_at, sequence).
- Depth is exposed on /health and /metrics.

### 5.4 Worker loop

```
loop forever:
  record = entry_queue.get()                       # blocks while empty
  if record.abandoned: audit(skipped); continue
  if now - record.arrived_at > record.max_wait_ms:
      record.slot.set_exception(QueueWaitExceeded); audit; continue
  entry = registry.get(record.tool)
  if entry is None:            slot <- ToolUnknown;    audit; continue
  if not entry.verified:       slot <- ToolUnverified; audit; continue
  if not policy.allows(record.caller, entry):  slot <- ToolForbidden; audit; continue
  t0 = now
  try:
      result = await entry.handler(**record.args)           # runs the tool
      if policy.redact(record.caller): result = redactor.apply(result)
      record.slot.set_result(result)
  except Exception as e:
      record.slot.set_exception(map_to_connector_error(e))
  audit(record, amd_calls, waited, elapsed, outcome)
```

- The worker awaits the handler; the handler awaits send(); send()
  awaits the request slot. While any of those is waiting, the worker is
  waiting. Nothing else runs a tool.
- MUST: a handler that raises leaves no partial result; the slot gets the
  exception only.
- MUST: handler argument validation happens against the tool's schema
  before the handler is called; invalid args produce ToolArgsInvalid
  without consuming any AMD calls.

---

## 6. AMD side

### 6.1 AMD request

```
XmlRequest
  id          uuid4
  record_id   uuid4             the tool call this belongs to
  action      str               "getdemographic"
  class_      str               "demographic"
  attrs       dict[str,str]     {"patientid": "12345"}
  children    list[Element]     field templates
  tier        int               from the tier table (section 7.4), not from the handler
  priority    int               copied from the record
  slot        asyncio.Future    lxml tree or exception
```

### 6.2 send()

The only function handlers may use to reach AdvancedMD.

```
async def send(req: XmlRequest) -> Element:
    req.tier = tier_table.lookup(req.action)
    request_queue.put(req)
    return await req.slot
```

- MUST: handlers never import httpx, requests, or the AMD URL. A test
  greps the domains/ tree for those imports and fails on any hit outside
  sender.py.
- Dependent AMD requests inside a handler are sequenced by the handler's
  own line order: the second send() is not created until the first
  returned. The queue has no dependency logic.
- Independent requests may be created together and awaited with
  asyncio.gather; the clock still paces them.

### 6.3 Request queue

- asyncio.PriorityQueue keyed on (priority, sequence). With one tool at a
  time it holds at most one item plus possibly a login request; the
  priority key exists so that the two-tools-in-flight upgrade
  (section 25) is an ordering change only.

### 6.4 Sender loop

```
loop forever:
  req = request_queue.get()
  await clock.acquire(req.tier)                          # may sleep
  if session.token is None: await session.login()        # section 8
  xml = build_xml(req, session.token)
  try:
      reply = await http.post(session.endpoint, content=xml, timeout=AMD_POST_TIMEOUT_S)
  except (ConnectError, ReadTimeout, 5xx):
      retry with backoff per section 15; on final failure slot <- AmdUnavailable; continue
  tree = parse(reply.content)
  fault = fault_code(tree)
  if fault in SESSION_TIMEOUT_CODES and not req.retried_after_relogin:
      await session.login(force=True)                     # through the clock, tier-1 login bucket
      req.retried_after_relogin = True
      resend once (same clock acquire, same request object); on second 1025 slot <- SessionFailed
      continue
  if fault is not None: slot <- AmdFault(code, message); continue
  req.slot.set_result(tree)
```

- MUST: build_xml sets msgtime in AMD's format, nocookie="1", and places
  the session token as a <usercontext> child element, never as an
  attribute (AMD returns HTTP 400 "Improperly Formatted Token"
  otherwise).
- MUST: clock.acquire is called for every post including retries and
  logins.

---

## 7. Rate clock

### 7.1 Source

AdvancedMD API Documentation, "API Usage Restrictions". Caps are per
office key, measured in one-minute intervals; exceeding a cap in any
interval bills $0.01 per excess call to the developer account.

### 7.2 Caps

Peak = Monday to Friday, 06:00 to 18:00 America/Denver.

| tier | peak/min | off-peak/min | AMD's named examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 | 60 | GETUPDATEDVISITS, GETUPDATEDPATIENTS |
| 2 | 12 | 120 | GETDEMOGRAPHIC, GETDATEVISITS, GETTXHISTORY, GETAPPTS, SAVECHARGES, UPDVISITWITHNEWCHARGES, GETPAYMENTDETAILDATA |
| 3 | 24 | 120 | all LOOKUP actions; any action not listed |
| login | 1 | 1 | observed: AMD returns 429 beyond about one login per 60 s per account |

### 7.3 Algorithm

- One bucket per (office key, tier) plus one login bucket.
- Each bucket holds a deque of send timestamps (monotonic).
- acquire(tier): drop timestamps older than 60 s; limit =
  floor(cap(tier, is_peak(now)) * CLOCK_MARGIN); if len < limit, append
  now and return; else sleep until the oldest timestamp is 60 s old, then
  re-evaluate (peak state may have changed while sleeping).
- CLOCK_MARGIN default 0.90. Configurable; MUST be <= 1.0.
- is_peak is evaluated at every acquire from the wall clock in
  America/Denver. Transition handling needs no special case: off-peak to
  peak holds until the window drains; peak to off-peak widens
  immediately.

### 7.4 Tier table

- A single table in connector/clock.py maps action name to tier. It is
  the only authority; handler constants (TIER = ...) in copied code are
  ignored.
- Seeded from AMD's examples plus every action in Appendix A. Unlisted
  actions default to tier 3 per AMD's "all other calls are Low Impact",
  except actions whose name begins with getupdated, which default to
  tier 1.
- Known correction versus copied code: getupdatedvisits is tier 1.

### 7.5 Persistence across restart

- MUST: on each acquire, the bucket's deque is appended to
  CLOCK_STATE_PATH (a small JSON file; one write per send is acceptable
  at these rates).
- On startup, buckets are loaded from that file and timestamps newer than
  60 s are honored. If the file is missing or unreadable, every bucket
  starts as if full for 60 s (conservative start).
- Rationale: a restart mid-minute must not let the new process double
  the minute's sends.

### 7.6 Per-caller caps

- Optional per-token caps (section 10.3) are enforced as a second
  acquire on a per-(caller, tier) bucket before the office-key bucket.
  Default: none. Intended use: keep a batch job from consuming the whole
  off-peak allowance.

---

## 8. Session and login

8.1 One login at startup. The login reply contains a redirect to the
    real regional endpoint; the connector follows it and stores endpoint
    and usercontext token in memory.

8.2 AMD publishes no session duration. Expiry is signalled by fault code
    1025 / -2147220479 "Session has timed out".

8.3 Recovery is inside the sender loop while it still holds the failed
    request (section 6.4): login again through the login bucket, resend
    the same request once, continue. No requeue; no explicit clock
    pause; the loop is serial so nothing else sends meanwhile.

8.4 MUST: at most one re-login per AMD request. A second 1025 fails the
    request with SessionFailed. Login refused (bad credentials, 429)
    fails the request with SessionFailed and sets session state to
    degraded (section 16).

8.5 Login MUST go through clock.acquire("login"). If the login bucket is
    full (a login happened < 60 s ago), the sender waits; it never
    hammers.

8.6 Proactive refresh: not built. Revisit if audit shows 1025 landing on
    interactive calls more than once a day.

8.7 /v1/login (admin-console credential check) uses a separate
    throwaway AmdSession object and the same login bucket. It never
    touches the connector's own session. Because the login bucket is
    1/min, concurrent staff logins serialize; the second waits up to
    60 s. Mitigation: a successful credential check is cached in memory
    for LOGIN_CHECK_CACHE_S (default 300 s) keyed by
    sha256(username + office_key + password); the cached path consumes no
    login slot. The cache is cleared on restart and never written to
    disk.

---

## 9. Tool registry and verification

### 9.1 Registry

- Built at startup from the nine copied domain packages (patients,
  visits, providers, codes, billing, payments, masterfiles, system, ehr)
  using their existing policy files and generated schemas, via the
  copied build_specs() machinery.
- Entry fields: name, domain, handler, schema, write_action, tier (from
  7.4), verified (bool), verified_at, verification_ref.
- Write tools are registered but gated: WRITE_TOOLS_ENABLED stays False
  globally; a write tool is served only if the caller's token has
  may_write for that tool (section 10.3). uploadfile is the only write
  tool expected to be enabled in version 1.

### 9.2 Verification states

- docs/TOOL_TO_XML_MAP.md found that many copied handlers call the client
  without a class name and with non-AMD attribute names; they raise
  TypeError before reaching AdvancedMD. Therefore every tool has a
  verification state and only verified tools are served.
- unverified (default): the worker returns ToolUnverified without running
  the handler or consuming AMD calls. The tool is still listed by
  GET /v1/tools and the MCP surface with "verified": false so agents can
  see it exists.
- verified: the handler has passed the checklist in 9.3 and its result
  shape is frozen in Appendix B.

### 9.3 Verification checklist (per tool)

A tool is marked verified only when all of the following are recorded in
docs/TOOL_TO_XML_MAP.md under its entry:

1. Request: exact action, class, attribute names, and children, confirmed
   against either the backend's vendored client (for Appendix A tools)
   or the AMD documentation.
2. Live check: one call against AdvancedMD by the operator on black-sky
   returned success="1". Date and AMD call count recorded. No bodies.
3. Fixture: a scrubbed recording of that reply exists under
   tests/fixtures/ (section 23.3 procedure) and a test asserts the
   handler's result dict against Appendix B.
4. Tier confirmed in the tier table.
5. Defects from Appendix C that affect this tool are fixed.

A tool with a ledger entry but an incomplete checklist is NOT verified.
In particular, while step 2 is still PENDING OPERATOR the tool reports
verified:false and returns tool_unverified.

CONNECTOR_SERVE_PENDING_VERIFICATION (section 19, default false) is the
one documented exception, for testing before the operator runs the live
check: when true, a tool whose ONLY missing checklist item is step 2 is
served, /health reports serving_pending_verification:true and status
degraded, and the tool still reports verified:false. When false, it
returns tool_unverified.

GET /v1/tools reports the checklist per tool as
"verification": {"request_map", "live_check", "fixture", "tier",
"defects"}, each either "pending" or what was recorded (for the live
check, the operator's date).

### 9.4 Launch set

The tools in Appendix A are verified before the connector serves
production traffic. All others launch unverified and are promoted one at
a time.

---

## 10. Callers, tokens, and policy

### 10.1 Token format and storage

- Token: 32 random bytes, base64url, prefixed with the caller name for
  operator readability: `validator_7f3a...`.
- Stored hashed (sha256) in the token table; the plaintext is shown once
  at issuance and never stored or logged.
- Token table: a JSON file at CONNECTOR_TOKENS_PATH, loaded at startup
  and re-read on SIGHUP or when its mtime changes (checked every 30 s).
  Shape:

```
{"callers": [
  {"name": "appointment-validator", "hash": "sha256:...", "priority": "batch",
   "phi": true, "raw_xml": false, "may_write": [], "tools": "*",
   "per_minute": null, "max_queue": 500, "created": "2026-08-20", "revoked": null}
]}
```

### 10.2 Issuance and lifecycle

- CLI inside the connector image:
  `connector tokens add <name> --priority batch|interactive [--phi] [--raw-xml] [--may-write uploadfile] [--tools a,b,c] [--per-minute N]`
  prints the plaintext once and appends the hashed entry.
  `connector tokens revoke <name>` sets revoked.
  `connector tokens list` shows names and policy, never hashes.
- Rotation: add a new token for the same name, deploy it to the
  consumer, revoke the old one. Two active tokens per name are allowed.
- Revoked tokens fail with 401 on the next request; in-flight records
  complete.

### 10.3 Policy fields

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| priority | interactive (0) or batch (1); sets entry-queue order and default max_wait_ms |
| phi | true: results returned unredacted; false: Redactor applied |
| raw_xml | true: tools that support it may return the raw AMD XML string in result["raw_xml"] (note-audit's fetch_note_raw) |
| may_write | list of write tool names this caller may invoke; empty = none |
| tools | "*" or an explicit allowlist of tool names |
| per_minute | optional per-caller cap applied before the office-key bucket |
| max_queue | max records this caller may have waiting; default 100 interactive, 500 batch |

### 10.4 Callers at launch

| caller | priority | phi | raw_xml | may_write | tools |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| admin-console | interactive | false | false | [] | (uses /v1/login only) |

| patient-intake | batch | true | false | [uploadfile] | lookuppatient, getdemographic, uploadfile |

Default deny: a tool not in the caller's list, or a write tool not in
may_write, returns ToolForbidden.

### 10.5 Office key

- One office key, set by AMD_OFFICE_KEY in the connector's environment.
  Tokens do not carry an office key in version 1. The clock and session
  are keyed on it so a later per-token office key is additive.

---

## 11. HTTP API

All endpoints except /health require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
Request and response bodies are JSON, UTF-8. docs/API.md mirrors this
section and is kept current.

### 11.1 POST /v1/tools

Request
```
{"tool": "getdemographic",
 "args": {"patient_id": "12345"},
 "max_wait_ms": 30000}                      optional; default from caller priority
```

Success 200
```
{"ok": true,
 "result": {...},                            handler dict, redacted per token
 "meta": {"request_id": "…", "waited_ms": 3200, "elapsed_ms": 4100,
          "amd_calls": 1, "tier": 2, "peak": true}}
```

Error (status per section 14)
```
{"ok": false,
 "error": {"code": "amd_fault", "message": "…", "amd_code": "1025", "retryable": false},
 "meta": {"request_id": "…", "waited_ms": 0, "elapsed_ms": 12}}
```

### 11.2 POST /v1/login

Forwarded-credential check for admin-console.
```
{"username": "…", "password": "…", "office_key": "…"}
-> 200 {"ok": true}  |  200 {"ok": false, "reason": "invalid_credentials"}
   | 503 {"ok": false, "error": {"code": "login_bucket_wait", "retry_after_ms": …}} if the
     login bucket is full and the caller set wait=false; default waits.
```
MUST: password is never logged, never cached in plaintext (8.7), never
forwarded anywhere but AMD's login endpoint.

### 11.3 GET /v1/tools

```
{"tools": [{"name": "getdemographic", "domain": "patients", "verified": true,
            "served": true,
            "verification": {"request_map": "…", "live_check": "pending" | "<date>",
                             "fixture": "…", "tier": "2", "defects": "fixed"},
            "write": false, "tier": 2, "schema": {...JSON schema...},
            "description": "…"}, …],
 "version": "1.0.0"}
```
Filtered to the caller's tools allowlist.

### 11.4 GET /health  (no token; internal network only)

```
{"status": "ok" | "degraded" | "starting",
 "instance_id": "…", "version": "1.0.0", "uptime_s": …,
 "session": {"state": "ok" | "none" | "degraded", "age_s": …, "last_login_at": …},
 "entry_queue": {"depth": …, "oldest_wait_ms": …},
 "request_queue": {"depth": …},
 "clock": {"peak": true, "tiers": {"1": {"used": 0, "limit": 0},
                                   "2": {"used": 4, "limit": 10},
                                   "3": {"used": 0, "limit": 21},
                                   "login": {"used": 1, "limit": 1}}},
 "registry": {"verified": 10, "unverified": 64},
 "serving_pending_verification": false}
```
status is degraded when the session is degraded, a queue is over 80%
of its cap, or CONNECTOR_SERVE_PENDING_VERIFICATION is true (section
9.3); starting until the first login attempt has completed.

### 11.5 GET /metrics  (no token; internal network only)

Prometheus text format. See section 18.

### 11.6 Versioning

- Path prefix /v1 is the contract version. Additive fields in responses
  are not a version bump. Removing or renaming a field, changing a
  verified tool's result shape, or changing an error code is a bump to
  /v2 alongside /v1 for one migration window.

---

## 12. MCP surface and agent installation

### 12.1 Principle

Tool names, argument schemas, descriptions, and redacted result shapes
are identical across: today's amd-mcp servers, the remote MCP surface,
and the local stdio shim. An agent config can be switched from one to
another without changing prompts.

### 12.2 Remote surface (hosted agents)

- The connector serves MCP over streamable HTTP at:
  `/mcp/patients`, `/mcp/visits`, `/mcp/providers`, `/mcp/codes`,
  `/mcp/billing`, `/mcp/payments`, `/mcp/masterfiles`, `/mcp/system`,
  `/mcp/ehr`, and `/mcp/all` (union, names unchanged).
- Authentication: bearer token in the Authorization header, same token
  table. The MCP session is bound to that token for its lifetime.
- tools/list returns the domain's verified tools with schemas; unverified
  tools are listed with "(unverified)" appended to the description and
  return ToolUnverified if called.
- tools/call is routed to the same receiver code path as POST /v1/tools
  with priority and redaction from the token. Errors map to MCP error
  responses with the connector error code in the message.
- Client config:
```
{"mcpServers": {"amd-patients": {"type": "http",
  "url": "http://advancedmd-connector:8820/mcp/patients",
  "headers": {"Authorization": "Bearer <agent token>"}}}}
```

### 12.3 Local shim (agents on a workstation)

- Python package `advancedmd-mcp`, published to the internal package
  index (and installable from the repo with uvx --from git+…). Entry
  point: `advancedmd-mcp --domain <name>` or `--domain all`.
- Speaks MCP over stdio to the agent. On start it calls GET /v1/tools
  on the connector, caches the list for the session, and advertises it.
  Each tools/call becomes POST /v1/tools. It holds no credentials, no
  tool logic, no AMD knowledge.
- Environment: ADVANCEDMD_CONNECTOR_URL, ADVANCEDMD_CONNECTOR_TOKEN.
  Missing either: exits with a clear message.
- Client config:
```
{"mcpServers": {"amd-patients": {"command": "uvx",
  "args": ["advancedmd-mcp", "--domain", "patients"],
  "env": {"ADVANCEDMD_CONNECTOR_URL": "http://100.94.62.115:8820",
          "ADVANCEDMD_CONNECTOR_TOKEN": "<agent token>"}}}}
```

### 12.4 Claude Code plugin

- `plugin/` in the repo contains `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (name
  advancedmd, version, description) and `.mcp.json` declaring nine stdio
  servers per 12.3 with `${ADVANCEDMD_CONNECTOR_URL}` and
  `${ADVANCEDMD_CONNECTOR_TOKEN}` environment references.
- `claude plugin add <path or repo>/plugin` installs all nine. The same
  `.mcp.json` is valid for Cursor and Claude Desktop by copy.
- A test starts the shim against a mock connector and asserts tools/list
  parity with the remote surface.

### 12.5 Chatbot (Adam)

- Recommendation adopted: the chatbot attaches to the remote surface
  (12.2) with its own token instead of spawning MCP subprocesses. Its
  shared_token module, boot-time AMD login, and AMD_* environment are
  removed at its migration step.

---

## 13. Backend SDK (lib/advancedmd_connector)

Lives in orlando-derm-backend/lib/advancedmd_connector/. HTTP only. No
AMD credentials, no XML, no AMD URL. A CI grep enforces this
(section 23.6).

### 13.1 Construction

```
connector = AmdConnector.from_env()            # ADVANCEDMD_CONNECTOR_URL, ADVANCEDMD_CONNECTOR_TOKEN
connector = AmdConnector(url, token, timeout_s=None)
```

### 13.2 Generic call

```
connector.tool(name: str, **args) -> dict      # result dict; raises per 13.4
```

### 13.3 Typed wrappers (names preserved from the vendored clients)

| method | tool(s) | returns |
|---|---|---|
| login_check(username, password, office_key) | POST /v1/login | bool |
| get_patient_bundle(patient_id) | getdemographic | PatientBundle |
| get_appointments_via_reminders(date, apptstatus_codes=None) | getreminderappts | list[VisitRecord] |
| get_visits_for_date(date) | getdatevisits | list[VisitRecord] |
| get_updated_visits(since) | getupdatedvisits | list[VisitRecord]; sets .last_servertime |
| search_patients_by_name(last, first, page=1, exactmatch=False) | lookuppatient | list[dict] |
| get_chart_files(patient_id) | getdemographic | list[AMDChartFile] |
| uploadfile(patient_id, file_name, file_contents_b64, filetype, description) | uploadfile | str (document ref) |

- Dataclasses PatientBundle, VisitRecord, AMDInsurancePlan,
  AMDReferralPlan, AMDChartFile, CallLog move into the lib unchanged
  (union of the four vendored copies; VisitRecord includes
  patient_middlename).
- Range/loop behavior stays on the caller side: one tool call per date,
  so each re-enters the entry queue and interactive calls interleave.
- uploadfile enforces the 1024 KB decoded cap client-side before
  calling, as today, and is never retried automatically (13.5).
- note-audit keeps its fetch_* layer and its action allowlist; its
  transport becomes connector.tool(...) with result["raw_xml"] for
  fetch_note_raw.

### 13.4 Exceptions (preserved names)

```
AMDError(Exception)                 base, as today
  AuthError(AMDError)               unauthorized token; login_check refused; session_failed
  APIError(AMDError)                amd_fault (has .code, .fault as today), tool_forbidden, tool_unverified, tool_unknown, tool_args_invalid
  ConnectorError(AMDError)          new: queue_wait_exceeded, queue_full, connector_timeout, amd_unavailable, transport failure to the connector
```
Existing `except (AuthError, APIError)` sites keep working. New code
may catch ConnectorError for retry decisions.

### 13.5 Retries in the SDK

- Idempotent reads (every tool except uploadfile): on ConnectorError with
  retryable=true (queue_full, amd_unavailable, connector_timeout,
  transport failure) retry up to 3 times with backoff 1 s, 3 s, 9 s.
- uploadfile: never retried automatically. On ConnectorError the caller
  must call get_chart_files to determine whether the upload landed
  before deciding.
- Never retry on APIError or AuthError.

### 13.6 Timeouts

Client timeout = max_wait_ms + EXECUTION_ALLOWANCE_MS (section 15) + 5 s
network margin, so the connector's own errors always arrive before the
client gives up.

---

## 14. Errors, end to end

| code | HTTP | retryable | raised in SDK as | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| bad_request | 400 | no | APIError | malformed body |
| unauthorized | 401 | no | AuthError | unknown or revoked token |
| tool_unknown | 404 | no | APIError | no such tool |
| tool_unverified | 409 | no | APIError | tool exists, not yet verified |
| tool_forbidden | 403 | no | APIError | caller policy denies this tool |
| tool_args_invalid | 422 | no | APIError | args fail the tool schema |
| queue_full | 503 | yes | ConnectorError | global or per-caller queue cap |
| queue_wait_exceeded | 504 | yes | ConnectorError | max_wait_ms elapsed before the tool started |
| connector_timeout | 504 | yes | ConnectorError | receiver gave up waiting on the slot |
| amd_unavailable | 502 | yes | ConnectorError | network/5xx to AMD after retries |
| amd_fault | 502 | no | APIError | AMD returned success="0"; amd_code and message included |
| session_failed | 502 | no | AuthError | re-login refused or second 1025 |
| login_bucket_wait | 503 | yes | ConnectorError | /v1/login with wait=false and bucket full |
| internal | 500 | yes | ConnectorError | unexpected exception; request_id for correlation |

MUST: error messages never include args, result content, or AMD
response bodies. amd_fault includes AMD's code and its short description
only.

---

## 15. Timeouts, limits, and retries

| name | default | where | configurable |
|---|---|---|---|
| max_wait_ms (interactive) | 20000 | record | per request, capped at 60000 |
| max_wait_ms (batch) | 300000 | record | per request, capped at 900000 |
| EXECUTION_ALLOWANCE_MS | 120000 | receiver timeout = max_wait + this | env |
| BATCH_AGING_MS | 60000 | entry queue promotion | env |
| AMD_POST_TIMEOUT_S | 30 | sender | env |
| AMD retry schedule | 1 s, 3 s (2 retries) on connect error, read timeout, 5xx | sender | code |
| CLOCK_MARGIN | 0.90 | clock | env, <= 1.0 |
| LOGIN_CHECK_CACHE_S | 300 | /v1/login | env |
| global entry-queue cap | 2000 records | receiver | env |
| per-caller queue cap | 100 interactive / 500 batch | token | token table |
| MCP session idle timeout | 3600 s | MCP surface | env |
| shutdown drain | 30 s | lifecycle | env |
| uploadfile decoded size cap | 1024 KB | SDK and handler | code |

Handlers MUST NOT sleep or retry on their own; pacing and retries belong
to the sender loop.

---

## 16. Lifecycle

### 16.1 Startup

1. Load config; fail fast on missing AMD_USERNAME, AMD_PASSWORD,
   AMD_OFFICE_KEY, CONNECTOR_TOKENS_PATH.
2. Load token table; fail fast if unreadable or empty.
3. Load clock state (7.5) or start conservative.
4. Build registry; log counts of verified/unverified; fail fast if any
   Appendix A tool is missing from the registry.
5. Start worker loop and sender loop.
6. Begin serving: /health reports "starting".
7. Attempt login through the login bucket. Success: status ok. Refused
   (429 or bad credentials): status degraded; keep serving; retry login
   on the login bucket with backoff 60 s, 120 s, 300 s, then every
   300 s; records that reach the sender while the session is absent wait
   for the next login attempt up to their max_wait, then fail with
   session_failed.
8. MUST NOT crash-loop on login failure. Bad credentials are logged
   once per attempt without the credentials.

### 16.2 Shutdown (SIGTERM)

1. Stop accepting new records: POST /v1/tools and MCP tools/call return
   503 queue_full with Retry-After: 5.
2. Let the worker drain the entry queue for up to the shutdown drain
   window; records still waiting after that get connector_timeout.
3. Let the sender finish the in-flight AMD request (never abandon a
   request mid-post).
4. Flush clock state. Exit.

### 16.3 Restart and deploy

- Coolify deploys are rolling-free (one replica); there is a gap. SDK
  retries (13.5) cover it for reads. Deploy SHOULD be scheduled outside
  batch windows; the README lists the batch schedule.
- Clock state persists (7.5). Session does not; a fresh login consumes
  the login bucket, so two restarts within a minute produce a degraded
  start that self-heals.

---

## 17. PHI, audit, logging, security

### 17.1 Data classification

- args and results may contain PHI. They exist in memory only and are
  returned to the caller. They are never written to disk by the
  connector, never logged, never included in errors or metrics.
- The raw_xml path returns AMD's XML string to callers whose token
  allows it; same rules.
- The token table contains no PHI. The clock state file contains
  timestamps only. The login-check cache is in memory only.

### 17.2 Audit line (one per tool call, structured JSON to stdout)

```
{"ts": "...", "request_id": "...", "caller": "appointment-validator",
 "tool": "getdemographic", "priority": "batch", "outcome": "ok" | "<error code>",
 "amd_calls": 1, "amd_actions": ["getdemographic"], "tier": 2,
 "waited_ms": 3200, "elapsed_ms": 4100, "peak": true, "relogin": false}
```
Never args, never results, never AMD bodies, never patient identifiers.
A test asserts the audit serializer rejects any key outside this set.

### 17.3 Logging

- Levels: INFO for lifecycle and audit; WARNING for degraded states,
  429s, 1025s; ERROR for internal exceptions with request_id. DEBUG is
  never enabled in production; even at DEBUG, bodies are not logged
  (enforced by a single log filter that redacts any value > 200 chars
  and any key named password, token, usercontext, result, args).
- MUST: no library's debug logging of HTTP bodies is enabled (httpx
  logging pinned to WARNING).

### 17.4 Network and transport

- The connector binds to the Docker compose network and the Tailscale
  interface only. No public port. /health and /metrics are unauthenticated
  but unreachable from outside the tailnet.
- Transport inside the tailnet is WireGuard-encrypted by Tailscale; no
  additional TLS termination in version 1. Recorded as an accepted risk
  in CONNECTOR_DECISIONS.md with the condition that the tailnet remains
  the only route.
- AMD traffic is HTTPS with TLS 1.2+ as AMD requires.

### 17.5 Secrets

- AMD credentials and the token table path come from the Coolify
  environment. They are never in the image, the repo, or the logs.
- Tokens are stored hashed; plaintext is shown once at issuance.
- /v1/login forwards user-supplied credentials to AMD only.

### 17.6 Compliance review

The build is not deployable until an annoying-compliance-officer review
returns APPROVE or APPROVE-WITH-CONDITIONS on sections 17.1 to 17.5 and
on the audit and log tests.

---

## 18. Observability

### 18.1 /metrics (Prometheus text)

```
connector_tool_calls_total{caller,tool,outcome}
connector_tool_wait_seconds{caller,priority}          histogram
connector_tool_elapsed_seconds{tool}                   histogram

connector_clock_limit{tier}                            gauge
connector_clock_sleep_seconds_total{tier}              counter

connector_up{instance_id}                              gauge
```

### 18.2 Alerts (documented; wiring is an ops task)

- connector_up absent for 2 min.
- connector_session_login_refused_total increasing for 10 min.
- connector_clock_used >= connector_clock_limit for any tier sustained 5 min
  (means callers are saturating the cap; not an error, but visible).
- p95 connector_tool_wait_seconds{priority="interactive"} > 10 s.
- any AMD 429 observed (should be zero after cutover).

## 21. Deployment

- Coolify project `advancedmd-connector` on black-sky. One service, one
  replica, port 8820 mapped on the host (ports_mappings), reachable on
  the compose network and the tailnet only.
- Volume: /data for clock.json and the token table.
- Env per section 19. AMD credentials exist only here.
- Health check: GET /health, healthy when status is ok or degraded
  (degraded still serves), unhealthy only when the process is down.
- The existing amd-mcp project and its nine containers are not touched.
  They are stopped at the end of migration (section 22), not before.
- Deploy method: standard Coolify deploy from the repo; avoid force
  rebuilds during batch windows.

---

## 22. Migration and cutover

Each backend service carries AMD_TRANSPORT=legacy|connector until done.
Order, with the gate for each:

| step | who | gate to proceed |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | connector deployed | /health ok for 24 h; Appendix A tools verified; clock metrics visible; compliance APPROVE |
| 1 | admin-console via /v1/login | staff logins succeed for 3 days; remove its AMD vendored client and env |
| 2 | agents: Cursor and local agents via plugin or remote; chatbot via remote surface | tools/list parity test green; chatbot shared_token removed |
| 3 | appointment-validator | one nightly run on connector matches legacy output on the same date (operator compares on the box) |
| 4 | srt-auths | one scan and one event run green |
| 5 | note-audit | one daily run green; raw_xml path exercised |
| 6 | patient-intake | dry-run green; then a single gated upload with INTAKE_WRITE_ENABLED and signed marker, verified via get_chart_files |
| 7 | retire | stop amd-mcp containers; delete vendored clients; remove AMD_* from every consumer; CI invariant (23.6) on |

Rollback at any step: flip AMD_TRANSPORT back to legacy; the vendored
client is not deleted until the step's gate passes.

## 23. Testing and acceptance

### 23.1 Unit

- Entry queue: priority order, FIFO within priority, batch aging,
  max_wait refusal, abandoned skip, per-caller and global caps.
- Clock: caps at 90% for each tier at peak and off-peak; transition at
  06:00 and 18:00 Denver; DST dates; persistence round-trip; conservative
  start.
- Sender: build_xml shape (usercontext as child element); retry schedule;
  1025 → exactly one re-login and one resend; second 1025 → session_failed;
  login refused → degraded state.
- Session: redirect handling; login bucket respected; /v1/login cache.
- Tokens: hashing, revocation, policy evaluation, default deny, CLI.
- Registry: unverified refused without AMD calls; Appendix A present.
- Errors: every code maps to the table in section 14; SDK exception
  mapping.
- Audit: serializer rejects disallowed keys; logging filter redacts.

### 23.2 Integration (mock AMD server in-process)

- Each Appendix A tool: request XML matches its fixture's recorded
  request; result dict equals Appendix B.
- API: every endpoint, every error code, auth on every route except
  /health and /metrics.
- MCP surface: tools/list per domain; tools/call routes through the
  worker; error mapping.
- Shim parity: stdio shim against the mock connector lists identical
  tools to the remote surface.
- Lifecycle: startup with login refused serves degraded; SIGTERM drains.

### 23.3 Fixture procedure (PHI never enters an agent's context)

1. Operator runs scripts/record_fixture.py on black-sky with real
   credentials for one tool and one synthetic or consented test patient.
2. The script posts the request, saves the request XML as-is, and passes
   the reply through a scrubber that replaces every attribute value in a
   PHI allowlist (name, dob, address, phone, ssn, chart, email, memo,
   note text) with deterministic synthetic values, preserving structure
   and ids' formats.
3. The operator reviews the scrubbed file on the box and commits it.
4. Agents only ever read committed fixtures. Any agent task that needs a
   new fixture stops and asks the operator.

### 23.4 Live (operator-run, on the box)

- One call per Appendix A tool against AdvancedMD through the connector;
  audit lines checked for ids-only; /metrics checked for counts.
- /v1/login with a real staff credential and with a wrong password.

### 23.5 Load and fairness

- A batch token submits 200 getdemographic calls; an interactive token
  submits one every 5 s. Assert: every interactive call starts within one
  tool's duration plus queue wait; the clock never exceeds any cap; no
  batch call waits past BATCH_AGING_MS without promotion.
- Restart mid-load: assert the clock does not exceed the cap in the
  minute spanning the restart.

### 23.6 Invariants (CI, both repos)

- connector: no httpx/requests import and no AMD URL outside
  connector/sender.py and connector/session.py; no blocking call on the
  event loop (a test injects a slow AMD reply and polls /health).
- backend: no file outside lib/advancedmd_connector/ may contain
  partnerlogin.advancedmd.com, AMD_USERNAME, AMD_PASSWORD, or define a
  class named AMDClient. Runs in pytest for the whole tree.

### 23.7 Acceptance

The connector is accepted for step 0 when 23.1, 23.2, 23.5, and 23.6 are
green in CI; 23.4 has been run by the operator; and 17.6 has returned
APPROVE or APPROVE-WITH-CONDITIONS with conditions closed.

## 24. Documentation deliverables

- README.md: what it is (two paragraphs), architecture diagram, run
  locally in five commands, attach an agent (remote, shim, plugin), use
  from a workflow (SDK), issue a token, where to look when something is
  slow (/health, /metrics), batch schedule, link to SPEC and decisions.
- CLAUDE.md: repo map, the invariants in 4.4, 6.2, 17.2, 23.6, traversal
  order, "never modify domains/ handlers without updating
  TOOL_TO_XML_MAP.md".
- docs/API.md: section 11 verbatim, kept current.
- docs/OPERATIONS.md: tokens CLI, deploy, rollback, alerts, fixture
  procedure.
- docs/CONNECTOR_DECISIONS.md: amended with D18 (tailnet-only transport
  accepted risk), D19 (login-check cache), D20 (clock persistence).
- orlando-derm-backend: docs/API.md, docs/PORTS.md (8820),
  docs/WORKFLOWS.md updated; each migrated service's CLAUDE.md notes the
  SDK.

## 25. Open items and deferred work

- Two tools in flight with priority-ordered sending: sender loop sorts
  the request queue by priority; worker concurrency becomes 2 with one
  slot reserved for interactive. Revisit after a month of metrics.
- Proactive session refresh (8.6).
- Per-token office key (10.5).
- TLS termination inside the tailnet (17.4) if the tailnet ever stops
  being the only route.
- /v2 normalized JSON results (N2).
- Promotion of remaining unverified tools, one at a time, via 9.3.

## Appendix A. Verified tools at launch

| tool | domain | AMD action / class | tier | used by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| getdemographic | patients | getdemographic / demographic | 2 | validator, srt-auths, note-audit, intake, agents |
| getreminderappts | patients | getreminderappts / api | 2 | validator, srt-auths, note-audit |
| getdatevisits | visits | getdatevisits / api | 2 | validator (fallback), agents |
| getupdatedvisits | visits | getupdatedvisits / api | 1 | srt-auths event runner |
| lookuppatient | patients | lookuppatient / api | 3 | intake |
| uploadfile | patients | uploadfile / files | 2 | intake (write; may_write gated; 1024 KB cap) |
| getehrnotes | ehr | getehrnotes / (per note-audit client) | 2 | note-audit (raw_xml) |
| gettxhistory | payments | gettxhistory / (per note-audit client) | 2 | note-audit |
| getchargedetaildata | billing | getchargedetaildata / (per note-audit client) | 2 | note-audit |
| login (internal) | | login / login | login bucket | connector; /v1/login |

Reference implementations for request XML: the backend's vendored
clients (appointment-validator, srt-auths, patient-intake, note-audit).
Classes marked "per note-audit client" are taken from that client's code
during verification and recorded in TOOL_TO_XML_MAP.md.

## Appendix B. Result shapes for verified tools

Frozen at verification. Changing any is a /v2 event. Shapes are the
handler dicts after serialization, before redaction. Documented in full
in docs/TOOL_TO_XML_MAP.md under each tool as "result shape"; the SDK's
dataclass conversion and the fixture tests are written against those
entries. This appendix is a pointer so the freeze rule is in the
contract.

## Appendix C. Known defects in copied handlers (from TOOL_TO_XML_MAP.md)

1. Many handlers in ehr, masterfiles, system, providers, codes call
   safe_amd_call without class_ and with Python-style attribute names
   (patient_id instead of patientid); they raise TypeError before any
   XML is built. These remain unverified until fixed per 9.3.
2. getdemographic(chart_number=...) forwards chart_number into
   get_patient_bundle, which accepts only patient_id. Fix during
   verification of getdemographic.
3. getmaster_patient sends attribute patient_id instead of patientid.
4. getupdatedvisits is marked tier 2 in handler and policy; AMD lists it
   as tier 1. The tier table (7.4) overrides; the policy file is
   corrected in the copy.
5. uploadfile in the copied patients package is a NotImplementedError
   stub; patient-intake's vendored implementation (1024 KB cap, file
   element with grouplist MISC) is the reference and replaces the stub.

## Appendix D. Amendments ratified before build (2026-08-20)

D-1 Tool naming. Policy tool_name values (e.g. amd_patients_get_demographic)
    are canonical. Each Appendix A tool also registers its bare AMD action
    (e.g. getdemographic) as an alias; token allowlists and POST /v1/tools
    accept either; GET /v1/tools lists aliases; MCP tools/list advertises
    canonical names only, preserving 12.1 parity with amd-mcp.
D-2 No vendored AMD client. amd-mcp's amd_client/client.py is not copied
    (it opens sockets, violating 6.2). connector/client_shim.py provides an
    AMDClient-shaped facade (call, get_patient_bundle, get_visits_for_date,
    get_appointments_via_reminders) that builds XmlRequest objects and
    awaits send(), so copied handler call sites are unchanged.
    amd_mcp_common.rate_limit is likewise not copied; connector/clock.py is
    the only clock.
D-3 Appendix C defect 1 is fixed only where it blocks an Appendix A tool;
    all other affected tools remain unverified per 9.2.
D-4 "login (internal)" in Appendix A is not a registry tool; it is
    session.login plus the /v1/login route.
